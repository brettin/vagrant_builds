BAYSIC: a Bayesian method for combining sets of genome variants with improved specificity and sensitivity

Some observations:

It comes with a not so permissive license. Free for academic use only. The authors have a financial interest in Genformatic.
Itâ€™s available in bitbucket. The installation instructions are basically OK.
It requires R, and getting the correct versions of the R packages and related dependencies made the install take some time.
It comes with a test, the test seems reasonable, and it passes.
At this point, testing against some real data would be interesting.
